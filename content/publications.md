description: "This paper proposes a matching model of the labor market with job rationing: unemployment persists even without matching frictions. Published in AER, 2012." 
summary: "This paper proposes a matching model of the labor market with job rationing: unemployment does not disappear in the absence of matching frictions. In recessions, job rationing drives the rise of unemployment, whereas matching frictions contribute little to it."
