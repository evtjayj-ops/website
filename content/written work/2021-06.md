#### Abstract 

This thesis examines why the July and October 1997 Burnham talks succeeded in producing a durable truce in the Bougainville Civil War after thirteen failed negotiations. I argue that the incorporation of Melanesian _trautim_ and Māori _pōwhiri_ functioned as indigenous diplomacies that mitigated destabilising dynamics present in earlier, conventionally-structured talks by creating a culturally responsive negotiating environment. The thesis finds  that, alongside ripeness theory, indigenous diplomacy offers a more holistic explanation of the Burnham talks’ success by emphasising  participant ownership, cultural legitimacy, and sustainability.
