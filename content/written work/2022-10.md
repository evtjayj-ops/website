#### Abstract 

This article assesses Aotearoa New Zealand’s much-vaunted turn to indigenous diplomacy following the appointment of Nanaia Mahuta, the country's first Māori foreign minister. I argue that, despite strong rhetoric, the disconnect between Māori values and everyday diplomatic practice risks reducing this shift to institutional window-dressing. The article summarises that without sustained bureaucratic and political buy-in, indigenous diplomacy will remain symbolic rather than truly transformative.
