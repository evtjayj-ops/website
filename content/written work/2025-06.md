#### Abstract 

This thesis explores how the Māori Renaissance has reshaped Aotearoa New Zealand’s national identity and, indirectly, its Pacific diplomacy since the 1970s. I argue that shifts in Māori–Pākehā relations generated by the Renaissance have filtered through national identity in cyclical waves, producing uneven but meaningful changes in how New Zealand acts and presents in the Pacific. The thesis concludes that identity decolonisation offers a valuable framework for understanding these diplomatic shifts, challenging the assumption that foreign policy is identity-neutral and showing diplomacy to be inseparable from a state’s internal colonial reckoning.
