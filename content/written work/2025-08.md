## Abstract 

This article responds to then Prime Minister Chris Hipkins' [July 2023 foreign affairs speech](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/prime-ministers-foreign-policy-speech-nziia) - his first as PM - where he announced a continuation of Aotearoa New Zealand's long-standing "values-based" foreign policy. I argue that 'business as usual' has let this policy lose clarity, credibility, and direction while insulating it from meaningful public scrutiny. I advocate for a people-driven reset – rooted in public debate and indigenous principles – to replace a foreign policy that now risks inconsistency, reputational damage, and strategic drift.
