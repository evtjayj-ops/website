#### Abstract 

This article examines how personality, impulse, and political ego are increasingly shaping Aotearoa New Zealand’s Pacific diplomacy under the Luxon government. I argue that sidelining institutional strategy and diplomatic expertise has eroded trust, mana, and predictability in Pacific relationships. The article calls for a return to disciplined, strategy-led Pacific engagement that rises above individual personalities and restores a steady hand to New Zealand’s regional diplomacy.
