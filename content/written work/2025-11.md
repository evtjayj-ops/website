#### Abstract 

This chapter analyses how indigenous diplomacy shaped the success of the 1997 Burnham peace talks that helped end the Bougainville Civil War. I argue that Melanesian _trautim_ and Māori _pōwhiri_ operated as substantive diplomatic practices that reconfigured relationships, lent legitimacy, and secured commitment in ways conventional negotiation models could not. The chapter finds that, alongside ripeness theory, indigenous diplomacy provides a more complete explanation for the durability of the Burnham outcomes and demonstrates the diplomatic power of culturally-grounded Pacific practices.
