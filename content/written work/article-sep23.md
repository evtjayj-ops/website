#### Abstract

New Zealand’s long-standing “values-based” foreign policy has drifted into business as usual, losing clarity, credibility, and direction while remaining largely insulated from public scrutiny. The article argues for a people-driven reset—rooted in public debate and indigenous principles—to replace a foreign policy that now risks inconsistency, reputational damage, and strategic drift.
